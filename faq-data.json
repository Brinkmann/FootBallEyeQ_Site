      "question": "What is Football EyeQ?",
      "answer": "Football EyeQ is a cognitive training platform that helps coaches develop game intelligence in players. While traditional training focuses on technical skills in isolation, Football EyeQ bridges the gap between technical ability and cognitive awareness. The platform provides a curated library of 100+ research-backed drills, intelligent filtering to design progressive sessions, season planning tools, and smart LED cone integration. Think of it as your complete system for teaching players to see more, think faster, and decide better on the pitch.",

      "question": "Why is cognitive training important in football?",
      "answer": "Research shows that elite players scan the field 8x more than average players before receiving the ball, and make decisions in 0.5 seconds under match pressure. Players who scan more have 23% better pass accuracy. Traditional training often focuses on technical skills in predictable environments, but real matches require constant scanning, processing information about 21 moving players, and split-second decisions under pressure. Cognitive training systematically develops these mental skills alongside technical ability. By training players to see more, think faster, and decide better, you're giving them the game intelligence that separates good players from elite ones.",

Premium accounts ($29/month) unlock the full 12-session season planner so you can plan your entire season progression, unlimited favorites to build a complete coaching library, session stats and analytics, and export functionality. The key difference is planning scope: Free lets you plan week-to-week, while Premium enables full seasonal progression from Basic to Elite difficulty over 12 weeks.

      "answer": "Great question! This is a key distinction. **Plastic exercises** use traditional cones that you manually set up - these are the static cones every coach has. **EyeQ exercises** are designed for smart LED cones that light up in dynamic patterns controlled from the app. The cognitive difference is significant: with plastic cones, players can predict patterns and rely on memory. With smart LED cones, lights change unpredictably, forcing players to constantly scan, process visual information, and make real-time decisions - just like in a match. Both types teach the same cognitive principles, but EyeQ exercises add game-realistic unpredictability. The good news? You can use Football EyeQ with either equipment type!",

      "answer": "No, absolutely not! Football EyeQ works with traditional cones too. The drill catalogue includes both **Plastic exercises** (for traditional cones) and **EyeQ exercises** (for smart LED cones). When browsing drills, you can filter by exercise type to see only what you can run with your current equipment. Many coaches start with Plastic exercises using their existing cones, then add smart LED cones later when they want to add dynamic visual cognitive load. Both types teach the same cognitive principles - smart cones just automate the unpredictability. You get full value from the platform regardless of equipment.",

      "answer": "Smart LED cones bring your session plans to life! Here's the flow: First, you design your session in the Football EyeQ app by adding EyeQ exercises to your planner. When you're ready to train, click 'Generate Code' in your session - this creates a unique numeric code tied to your drill patterns. Send that code to your smart LED cones, and they'll execute the light sequences automatically. During training, the cones provide color-coded visual cues that change dynamically and unpredictably, forcing players to scan constantly. This creates game-realistic cognitive load - players can't rely on patterns or memory; they must scan, process, and decide in real-time. The result? Training that develops scanning habits automatically.",

As a **club coach**, you get all Premium features (12 sessions, unlimited favorites, stats) but your club admin controls your exercise type policy (EyeQ-only, Plastic-only, or Coach-choice) to ensure everyone uses the same equipment.

You can mix difficulty levels (start Basic, progress to Elite) and combine different decision themes for variety. Everything saves automatically to the cloud, so you can plan on your laptop and access from your phone on the pitch. Free accounts get 1 session planner, while Premium and Club accounts get the full 12 sessions for complete seasonal progression.",

      "answer": "Session codes are the bridge between digital planning and on-field execution with smart LED cones! When you've built a session with EyeQ exercises, click the 'Generate Code' button in your planner. This creates a unique 6-character numeric code that maps your drills to specific cone light patterns. You can display this as a QR code or enter it manually into your LED cone controller. The cones then execute the programmed light sequences for your drills automatically. This means you design strategically at home, then execute seamlessly on the pitch - no manual cone reprogramming between drills. Note: Session codes only work with EyeQ exercises and smart LED cone hardware. For Plastic exercises with traditional cones, you'll use the drill diagrams for manual setup.",

      "answer": "Community reviews help you learn from other coaches' real-world experience! Every drill in the catalogue shows a star rating (1-5 stars) based on reviews from coaches who've actually used it in training. You can see the average rating and total number of reviews on each exercise card. After you run a drill with your team, you can rate it to help other coaches. This creates a quality validation layer - popular drills that work well get higher visibility, while less effective drills are easy to spot. Think of it as coaching wisdom shared at scale. You don't have to test all 100+ drills yourself - you can learn from coaches who've already used them and see what works in real training environments.",

      "question": "What is the See-Think-Do methodology?",
      "answer": "See-Think-Do is the three-pillar framework that underpins all Football EyeQ drills. **SEE** trains visual awareness - players learn to constantly scan the field, gathering information about teammates, opponents, space, and the ball before they receive it. **THINK** develops rapid decision-making - processing that visual information to identify the best option (pass or dribble, attack or hold, shoot or pass) in under 0.5 seconds. **DO** builds confident execution - turning smart decisions into effective actions under pressure. Traditional training often jumps straight to 'Do' with isolated technical practice. Football EyeQ integrates all three pillars in every drill, because in real matches, players must see, think, AND do simultaneously. This is how you build complete, intelligent footballers.",

      "answer": "You can start as early as U7! The drill catalogue is organized into four age groups: **Foundation Phase (U7-U10)** focuses on building basic scanning habits and awareness in fun, simple drills. **Youth Development Phase (U11-U14)** adds decision-making under mild pressure with more complex scenarios. **Game Training Phase (U15-U18)** introduces game-realistic cognitive complexity and tactical awareness. **Performance Phase (U19-Senior)** delivers elite-level cognitive demands. The key insight: cognitive habits formed at 8-12 years old become automatic by 16. If you wait until players are teenagers to start cognitive training, you're trying to change ingrained habits instead of building good ones from the start. That said, it's never too late - even senior players benefit from systematic cognitive development.",

      "answer": "The drill catalogue organizes exercises into four age-based developmental phases: **Foundation Phase (U7-U10)** for early scanning habit formation with simple, fun drills; **Youth Development Phase (U11-U14)** for decision-making under mild pressure with moderate complexity; **Game Training Phase (U15-U18)** for game-realistic cognitive challenges and tactical awareness; and **Performance Phase (U19-Senior)** for elite-level cognitive demands. There's also a 'General/Unspecified' option for drills that work across multiple ages. When you filter by age group, you'll see drills pedagogically designed for that developmental stage - not just easier or harder, but cognitively appropriate for how players at that age learn and process information.",

      "answer": "Seasonal progression is built into the planner design! Start your season with Basic difficulty drills and simple decision themes. Weeks 1-3 might focus on fundamental scanning habits with Foundation or Youth Development age-appropriate exercises. Weeks 4-6 introduce Intermediate difficulty, adding game moments like Build-Up or Counter Attack. Weeks 7-9 move to Advanced drills with more complex decision themes (Pass or Dribble, Attack or Hold). Weeks 10-12 culminate in Elite difficulty with full game-realistic scenarios. The key is gradual progression - don't jump from Basic to Elite in one week. Layer complexity: start with individual exercises, progress to pairs, then small groups, then team units. Mix practice formats (Rondo → Positional Play → Small-Sided Games) for variety. The 6-dimensional filters help you map this progression systematically.",

The typical training flow is: warm-up drill first, main drills in the middle, small-sided game or cool-down last. When building your session, add drills in the order you intend to run them. If you need to reorder, the current approach is to remove drills and re-add them in the desired sequence. Future updates may add explicit drag-and-drop reordering. Session order matters for pedagogical progression (simple → complex within one session) and practical flow (high-intensity → recovery periods).

      "question": "What does 'Plastic' mean in exercise type?",
      "answer": "'Plastic' refers to traditional cone exercises - the standard static cones every coach already has. These are manually set up in specific patterns for drills, and they don't have any electronic components. The term 'Plastic' distinguishes these drills from 'EyeQ' drills that require smart LED cones. Plastic exercises teach the same cognitive principles (See-Think-Do, scanning, decision-making) but rely on coaching cues and manual pattern changes rather than automated light sequences. When you filter for Plastic exercises, you're seeing drills you can run with your existing equipment - no special purchase needed. This ensures Football EyeQ is accessible to all coaches regardless of equipment budget. Many successful coaches use only Plastic exercises and see excellent player development!",

      "question": "Why is this called an 'EyeQ site' if it includes Plastic exercises?",
      "answer": "Great observation! Football EyeQ is the platform brand - it represents the cognitive training methodology (See-Think-Do) and the complete ecosystem (Plan-Train-Enjoy). The 'EyeQ' name comes from developing players' 'Eye IQ' - their visual awareness and cognitive game intelligence. While the platform is designed to integrate with smart LED 'EyeQ' cones, it's built to serve ALL coaches, regardless of equipment. Plastic exercises are included specifically to help clubs get started with the methodology using traditional cones, with the option to add smart LED cones later as budget allows. Think of it this way: Football EyeQ is the coaching system; EyeQ cones are one tool within that system. The platform is 'EyeQ' because it develops Eye IQ in players - whether you use smart cones or traditional ones.",

      "question": "Our club wants to start with Plastic and upgrade to EyeQ later - how does that work?",
      "answer": "Perfect approach! Many clubs start exactly this way. As a club admin, set your exercise type policy to 'Plastic-only' when you register. All your coaches will see only traditional cone drills, and you can begin systematic cognitive training immediately with your existing equipment. Your coaches build session plans, develop the methodology, and see player improvement with Plastic exercises. When your club is ready to invest in smart LED cones (whether that's in 3 months or 3 years), simply change your exercise type policy to 'EyeQ-only' or 'Coach-choice' from your dashboard. Instantly, all your coaches gain access to smart cone drills. Their existing session plans remain, and they can now add EyeQ exercises or convert Plastic sessions to EyeQ versions. This staged approach lets you prove value with low upfront cost, then enhance with hardware when it makes sense financially.",
