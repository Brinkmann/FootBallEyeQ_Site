## What is Football EyeQ?

Football EyeQ is a **cognitive training platform** that transforms how football coaches develop game intelligence in their players.

While traditional training focuses on technical skills—passing, dribbling, shooting—in isolation, **Football EyeQ bridges the gap between technical ability and cognitive awareness**. It's built on a simple truth: elite players don't just have better feet; they have better brains.

The platform provides coaches with:
- A curated library of **100+ research-backed cognitive drills**
- **Intelligent filtering** to design progressive, game-realistic training sessions
- **Season planning tools** to organize an entire training cycle
- **Smart hardware integration** that brings cognitive challenges to life on the field
- **Community validation** through peer reviews and ratings

Football EyeQ doesn't replace coaching expertise—it **amplifies it** by handling the organization, discovery, and smart execution of cognitive development training.

---

## The Problem We Solve

### The Gap in Traditional Training

Most football training focuses on **technical execution** in controlled, predictable environments:
- Cones don't move
- Patterns are repetitive
- Players know what's coming next
- Drills isolate skills from decision-making

**But real football isn't like this.** In matches, players must:
- Scan constantly while the ball is in motion
- Process information about 21 other moving players
- Make split-second decisions under pressure
- Execute while physically and mentally fatigued

### The Cognitive Development Crisis

Research shows that:
- **Elite players scan 8x more** than average players before receiving the ball
- **Elite decisions happen in 0.5 seconds** under match pressure
- **Players who scan more have 23% better pass accuracy**
- **Most youth training doesn't systematically develop scanning habits**

The result? Players reach 16-18 years old with excellent technical skills but poor game intelligence—and by then, cognitive habits are much harder to change.

### What Football EyeQ Does Differently

Football EyeQ makes **cognitive development systematic, scalable, and measurable**:

1. **Systematic**: Research-backed drills organized by age, difficulty, and game moment
2. **Scalable**: From individual coaches to entire club organizations
3. **Measurable**: Community ratings show what works in real training environments
4. **Executable**: Smart hardware integration delivers cognitive challenges that traditional cones can't

We're not teaching players *what* to do—we're training them to **see more, think faster, and decide better** in the chaos of real matches.

---

## The See-Think-Do Methodology

Football EyeQ is grounded in three pillars of cognitive development:

### 🔍 SEE — Visual Awareness & Scanning

Train players to **constantly scan the field**, gathering visual information about:
- Teammate positions and movement
- Opponent positions and pressure
- Available space and passing lanes
- Ball location and trajectory

**Why it matters**: You can't make good decisions about what you haven't seen. Scanning is the foundation of game intelligence.

### 🧠 THINK — Rapid Decision-Making

Develop the ability to **process information and identify the best option** under pressure:
- Should I pass or dribble?
- Should I attack space or hold position?
- Should I shoot or pass?

**Why it matters**: Elite players make these decisions in 0.5 seconds. Average players take 2+ seconds—and by then, the opportunity is gone.

### ⚡ DO — Confident Execution

**Turn smart decisions into effective actions**:
- Execute with technical precision
- Act with confidence under pressure
- Adapt when the situation changes

**Why it matters**: Seeing and thinking mean nothing without the ability to execute decisively.

---

## What Makes Football EyeQ Unique

### 1. **Hardware-Software Integration**

Most training apps are just digital libraries. Football EyeQ bridges the gap between **planning** and **execution**:

- **Design sessions in the app** → **Execute with smart LED cones on the field**
- Color-coded light patterns provide visual cognitive load that mimics match pressure
- Dynamic, unpredictable patterns keep players engaged and scanning
- Session codes link digital planning to physical training

This is what makes cognitive training **scalable**—coaches don't have to manually create unpredictable environments; the hardware does it automatically.

### 2. **Intelligent 6-Dimensional Filtering**

The drill catalogue isn't just searchable—it's **pedagogically designed** to help coaches build progressive development:

| Filter Dimension | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Age Group** | Foundation Phase (U7-U10) → Youth Development (U11-U14) → Advanced (U15-U18) → Senior |
| **Decision Theme** | Specific cognitive choices: Pass or Dribble, Attack or Hold, Shoot or Pass |
| **Player Involvement** | Progression from Individual → Pairs → Small Groups → Team Units (5+ players) |
| **Game Moment** | Realistic scenarios: Build-Up, Counter Attack, Transition, Defensive Shape, Set Pieces |
| **Difficulty Level** | Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Elite |
| **Practice Format** | Rondo, Positional Play, Small-Sided Games, Shooting Patterns, Movement Patterns |

This allows coaches to:
- **Build progressively** across a season (start Basic, end Elite)
- **Target specific decisions** based on what players struggle with
- **Match game scenarios** that reflect their tactical system
- **Scale by team size** based on training group availability

### 3. **Complete Ecosystem Thinking: Plan → Train → Enjoy**

Football EyeQ isn't just a tool—it's a **complete training methodology**:

#### **PLAN**
- Browse 100+ drills with intelligent filtering
- Build 12-week seasonal progressions

### 3. **Smart LED Cone Integration**

**The breakthrough innovation**: Bridging planning and execution with intelligent hardware.

#### How It Works:
1. **Design sessions** in the Football EyeQ app (drills, order, progression)
2. **Generate session code**: Numeric code tied to specific drill patterns
3. **Send to smart cones**: Code triggers pre-programmed light sequences
4. **Run training**: Cones provide dynamic visual cues that change unpredictably

#### Why Smart Cones Matter:

**Traditional Cones**:
- Static positions (players know what's coming)
- No unpredictability (no need to scan)
- Manual setup changes (interrupts training flow)

**Smart LED Cones**:
- **Color-coded visual cues** that force scanning
- **Dynamic light sequences** that vary unpredictably
- **Instant pattern switching** without interruption
- **App-controlled** from coach's device

#### The Cognitive Load Difference:

In a traditional drill, a player might:
1. Receive the ball
2. Look up once
3. Execute pre-planned action

With smart LED cones, a player must:
1. **Scan before receiving** (where are the lights?)
2. **Scan again** (have the lights changed?)
3. **Process information** (which color means which action?)
4. **Decide** (pass left to green cone or dribble to blue cone?)
5. **Execute** (under time pressure while lights might change)

This is **game-realistic cognitive load**—players can't rely on memory or patterns; they must scan, think, and decide in real-time.

#### Hardware Setup:
- Currently mocked (ready for real hardware integration)
- Designed for IP-based LED cone controllers
- Configurable endpoint in `app/utils/coneControl.ts`
- Session codes map to specific pattern sequences

    }),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Cone controller error: ${response.statusText}`);
  }

  return { ok: true };
}
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: `npm run dev` (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Authentication**: Use Firebase Auth emulator or real Firebase project
3. **Database**: Firestore rules enforce user-specific access to planners
4. **Hardware Testing**: Mock cone responses in `app/utils/coneControl.ts`

### Deployment

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any Next.js-compatible hosting platform.

### Testing Smart Cone Integration

```bash
# Test cone controller endpoint manually
curl -X POST http://YOUR_CONTROLLER_IP/patterns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pattern": 42, "state": true}'
```
