Individual Coach
Start here
Plan sessions with plastic cones now; unlock smart EyeQ cones next.

1.
Sign up free at football-eyeq.com/signup to access the drill catalogue, one session planner, and up to 10 favourites.
2.
Build your first session in the Session Planner and run it with plastic cones—this teaches the same scanning principles as EyeQ hardware.
3.
To preview Premium during early access, email obrinkmann@gmail.com for a free upgrade. Premium unlocks the full 12-session planner, unlimited favourites, and stats.
4.
When EyeQ cones arrive, switch exercise type in the Drill Catalogue to EyeQ to add smart-light progressions; plastic drills remain available anytime.
Note: EyeQ exercises need the smart LED cones; Plastic exercises mirror the same cognitive demands using standard cones.
