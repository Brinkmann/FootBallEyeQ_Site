# Brand asset placement

To use your official branding on the site, upload your provided assets to the deployed site's `public/brand/user/` directory with these filenames:

- `logo-wordmark.svg` (or .png) — the main header wordmark
- `mark.svg` (or .png) — the small icon used in feature cards

Once these files are in place, the homepage will automatically display them. Until then, the page will show a reminder to add the assets rather than substituting placeholder graphics.
