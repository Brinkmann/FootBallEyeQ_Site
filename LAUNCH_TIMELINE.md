## Risks & Contingencies

**Risk 1:** Stripe integration takes longer than expected
**Mitigation:** Start earlier (Week 11), allocate 2 weeks instead of 1.5

**Risk 2:** User testing reveals major UX flaw
**Mitigation:** Fix immediately, delay other features if needed

**Risk 3:** Can't recruit enough testers
**Mitigation:** Offer better incentives, reach out to wider network

**Risk 4:** Pricing validation shows $29 is too high/low
**Mitigation:** Test multiple price points, be willing to adjust

## What Could Go Wrong (and How to Prevent)

**Scope creep:**
- Stick to the quick wins list
- No new features before launch
- Focus on polish, not adding

**Perfectionism paralysis:**
- Ship imperfect but functional
- Can iterate post-launch
- Done > perfect

**Ignoring user feedback:**
- Make time to watch ALL user sessions
- Act on consistent patterns
- Don't dismiss negative feedback

---

## Team Capacity Planning

**Assuming solo developer (you):**
- Development: 10-15 hours/week
- User testing: 3-5 hours/week
- Planning/admin: 2-3 hours/week
- **Total:** 15-23 hours/week

**3 months = ~180-275 hours total**

**Allocated:**
- Quick wins: 25 hours
- User testing: 40 hours
- Payment integration: 40 hours
- Content creation: 20 hours
- Analytics: 10 hours
- Bug fixes/iteration: 30 hours
- Launch prep: 15 hours
- **Total:** ~180 hours ✅ Realistic

*This timeline is aggressive but achievable. Key is consistency + not adding scope.*
