You are editing the Football EyeQ frontend codebase. The only issue I want you to fix is a potential mismatch between hyphens "-" and en dashes "–" in values that are used for filtering or internal comparisons.

Background:
- Drills and tags are stored in JSON / Firestore.
- The UI has filters such as Age Group, Group Size/Players, Difficulty, etc.
- Filters rely on exact string matches between:
  (a) tag values stored with each drill, and
  (b) tag values or enums defined in the frontend code.
- Some values currently use an en dash (for example "U7–U10", "U11–U14", "U15–U18", "Small Group (3–4 players)"), while others may use a normal hyphen ("-"). This can break filtering.

Your task is limited to internal functional use only:

1. Identify all tag values that are used for filtering or equality checks in the codebase.
   - This includes Age Group, Group Size/Players, Difficulty, and any other filter enums or tag lists used to query or filter drills.
   - Focus on the values that are compared in code or used in Firestore queries, not on general UI text.

2. For those filter tag values, standardise on the simple ASCII hyphen "-" as the canonical character.
   - Replace any en dash "–" occurrences in filter definitions / enums with "-".
   - Examples:
     "Foundation Phase (U7–U10)" → "Foundation Phase (U7-10)" or "Foundation Phase (U7-U10)" depending on the current project convention.
     "Youth Development Phase (U11–U14)" → "Youth Development Phase (U11-14)" or "Youth Development Phase (U11-U14)".
     "Game Training Phase (U15–U18)" → "Game Training Phase (U15-18)" or "Game Training Phase (U15-U18)".
     "Small Group (3–4 players)" → "Small Group (3-4 players)".

3. Search the exercise library JSON / seed data (any exercises.json or similar) for tag fields that participate in filtering (for example age group tags, group size tags, difficulty tags).
   - Where those tag fields contain en dashes, update them so they exactly match the canonical hyphenated values you defined in step 2.
   - Do not touch long-form text or descriptions in the JSON unless the field is explicitly used as a filter tag.

4. In the filter logic, add a small normalisation helper that is applied only at comparison points, to convert any remaining en dashes to a hyphen before comparing.
   - For example:

     function normaliseTag(value: string): string {
       return value.replace(/\u2013/g, "-").trim();
     }

   - Make sure that whenever a selected filter value is compared with a drill tag value, both are passed through normaliseTag.
   - This helper is only for internal comparisons. Do not use it to change what is displayed to the user.

5. Do NOT:
   - Do not change general UI copy, headings, marketing text or long descriptions just for typography.
   - Do not refactor unrelated code.
   - Do not introduce new features. Keep the change set minimal and focused on avoiding hyphen/en-dash mismatches in filter-related values.

When you are done, the behaviour should be:
- All filter tag definitions and drill tag values that are actually used for filtering use ASCII "-" consistently.
- The normalisation helper ensures that if an en dash sneaks in again in a tag field, filtering still works.
- No cosmetic or descriptive text is altered unless it is directly used as a filter key.
