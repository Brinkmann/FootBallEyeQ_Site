"Exercise ID 17 – Passing Grid – Adaptive Possession Grid Age Group Tag: Performance Phase (U19–Senior) Decision Theme Tag: Pass or Dribble Player Involvement Tag: Team Unit (5+ players) Game Moment Tag: Build-Up Difficulty Level Tag: Elite Practice Format Tag: Rondo / Tight Possession Exercise ID 17 – EyeQ Adaptive Possession Grid ### 2. Title & Basic Info Title: EyeQ Adaptive Possession Grid Age Range: U19–Senior Recommended Numbers: 8 players (6 attackers + 2 defenders, with rotations) ### 3. Drill Overview A high-intensity 6v2 possession game in a four-square grid. EyeQ SmartCones on the perimeter change colour, each colour activating a different global rule: defenders switch, attackers must break lines, or standard rules apply with a base movement constraint. Players must constantly scan and adapt their actions to the current colour. ### 4. Objective & Scanning Emphasis Objective: Develop elite-level scanning, rapid interpretation of multiple visual cues and tactical responses in a tight possession environment. Scanning emphasis: Attackers must read both player positions and the perimeter colour, knowing that blue changes defenders, red enforces line-breaking passes and yellow allows standard play. Failure to scan accurately leads to broken rules and immediate role changes, embedding the habit of linking perception to action. ### 5. Setup & Equipment Area: 16m x 16m grid, divided into four equal 8m x 8m squares. Players: 6 attackers inside the grid and 2 active defenders (with additional pairs ready to rotate in). Equipment required: 4 EyeQ SmartCones, 1 ball (plus spares), cones for square markings, bibs for attackers and defenders. EyeQ Smart Cone placement: One SmartCone centred on each sideline of the large grid, all showing the same colour at any given time. ### 6. EyeQ Cue Rules (Colour / Cue Key) - Blue = Defensive switch: the two current defenders must immediately leave the grid and a fresh pair of defenders enters. - Red = Break the lines: any pass must go to a player in a different square from the passer; passes within the same square are not allowed. - Yellow (or no light) = Standard play: normal possession rules apply, but base rule remains – after making a pass, a player must move into a different square. - Incorrect responses (e.g. passing within the same square on red) result in the offending two players becoming the new defenders. ### 7. How to Play (Step-by-Step) 1. Start with the 6 attackers spread across the four inner squares and 2 defenders applying pressure. 2. Attackers aim to keep possession, following the base rule: after passing, move into a different square. 3. EyeQ cones shift randomly between blue, red and yellow, applying the global rules. 4. When the light shows blue, defenders switch: they exit and a fresh defending pair quickly enters. 5. When the light shows red, attackers must only play line-breaking passes into different squares. 6. When the light is yellow or off, standard play continues with only the base movement rule. 7. Any failure to obey the current colour rule or loss of possession leads to immediate consequences (e.g. offending players become defenders). 8. Rotate defenders and attackers regularly to share load and maintain tempo. ### 8. Coaching Points - Constantly scan for both player positions and the colour of the cones. - Sharpen the perceive–decide–act cycle: see colour, recall rule, scan options, then execute. - High technical quality: crisp passing, sharp first touch and quick, purposeful movement between squares. - Defenders press intelligently, especially when a new rule might catch attackers off guard. - Encourage anticipation: players should think “If it turns red next, where can I pass?” ### 9. Progressions and Variations - Easier: Start with only yellow (standard play) and blue (defensive switch) to get used to scanning. - Easier: Allow occasional “mistake resets” without changing defender roles to build confidence. - Harder: Increase defensive intensity and reduce grid size slightly to compress time and space. - Harder: Add a new colour rule (e.g. green = all players must touch the ball before a repeat pass is allowed). - Harder: Track and penalise repeated rule errors to emphasise concentration (e.g. 3 errors = fitness for the group). ---"

overview
"An advanced possession grid where EyeQ SmartCones dynamically alter the rules of play in real-time. For instance, when a cone shows red, one team might have to play one-touch; when it shows blue, the defending team gains an extra player. These unpredictable shifts force elite-level players to continuously adapt their tactics, communication and technical execution."
