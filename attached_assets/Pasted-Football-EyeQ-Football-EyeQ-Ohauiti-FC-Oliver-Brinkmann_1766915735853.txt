002 - Dribbling Through Chaos

Players dribble freely inside a marked area, each with their own ball and wearing one of three bib colours (red, blue, or green). EyeQ SmartCones positioned around the perimeter cycle through colours, and players must scan to find a cone matching their bib colour while maintaining close control in traffic. When they reach a matching cone, they perform a turn and dribble back into space, continuously searching for their next target. This develops dribbling control, spatial awareness in crowded areas, and the habit of lifting the head to scan while moving with the ball.

007 - Neutral Zone Pass – Simultaneous Scan & Switch

A possession exercise with a central neutral zone where teams attempt to switch play from one side of the area to the other. EyeQ SmartCones positioned in or near the neutral zone display colour cues that indicate when and how the switch should be executed. Players must scan to identify the active cue whilst maintaining possession, time their long pass to coincide with the correct colour signal, and deliver accurate field-switching passes under pressure. The exercise develops spatial awareness, the ability to recognise switching opportunities, and the technical execution of long-range distribution.

006 - Follow the Ball – Shoulder Check Passing Pattern

Players work in passing combinations where the receiver must check their shoulder and scan before receiving the ball, with EyeQ SmartCones providing colour cues that determine the next action. After receiving and controlling the ball, players must identify which colour is active and pass to the corresponding position or player. This exercise emphasises the critical habit of scanning before the ball arrives, adopting an open body shape to see both ball and surroundings, and executing purposeful first touches that set up the next action.

003 - Scan to Strike – Four-Goal Switching Game

A small-sided game with four mini-goals positioned in the corners of the playing area, where EyeQ SmartCones beside each goal cycle through colours to indicate which goals are currently active. Teams must constantly scan the perimeter to identify open goals while maintaining possession and creating shooting opportunities. The exercise trains players to scan wide, recognise multiple attacking options simultaneously, and switch their point of attack quickly based on changing visual cues in game-realistic conditions.

038 - Triple-Task Switch Game

A high-intensity positional possession game where players must constantly scan both sidelines to identify which tactical task is currently live, as indicated by a specific pair of EyeQ smart cones lighting up. Each colour corresponds to a different game rule: hold possession patiently, switch play across the field, or attack directly. The challenge is to adapt decision-making, tempo, and team shape based solely on the visual cue, which operates independently of player actions. The mirrored cue layout ensures players develop full-field scanning habits under pressure, replicating the real-game need to check multiple directions before acting.

039 - Four-Sided Breakout with EyeQ Cues

A small-sided possession game where players can only break out through the touchline marked by a lit pair of EyeQ smart cones, with one gate (formed by a pair of cones) lighting up at a time to indicate the only legal breakout side. Players must scan all four sides of the pitch constantly, as the active exit can change without warning, and success depends on switching play quickly, recognising the current gate, and executing the breakout with a pass or dribble under control. This trains quick recognition of breakout opportunities by linking full-field scanning to directional decisions, whilst maintaining composure under pressure and adjusting to unpredictable cue changes.

011 - Chaos Possession – Neutral Trigger Game

A chaotic possession environment where EyeQ SmartCones around the perimeter signal when specific players become neutral helpers for the team in possession. Players must scan continuously to identify which neutrals are currently available, call for them effectively, and utilise them to maintain possession in a crowded, high-pressure situation. This develops rapid scanning in congested spaces, quick decision-making about when to use neutral support, and composure whilst processing multiple visual inputs simultaneously.

037 - Mirror Check Pass

Players work in pairs passing back and forth across a short distance, with an EyeQ SmartCone positioned beside the passing lane displaying changing colours. Before receiving each pass, the receiver must call out the current cone colour to demonstrate they have scanned, then control the ball and return the pass. This fundamental exercise develops the basic scanning habit of lifting the head before the ball arrives, training players to check their surroundings as an automatic part of every receiving action.

029 - Trapped Until Colour – Advanced Gates

Players are trapped in a confined area until EyeQ SmartCones display specific colour sequences that open gates for escape. Players must dribble in tight spaces whilst continuously scanning multiple gate locations, recognise the correct colour combination when it appears, and accelerate quickly through the opening before it closes. This trains composure whilst trapped under pressure, continuous multi-directional scanning, pattern recognition, and explosive reactions when opportunities arise.

004 - Dribbling with a Changing Target

Players dribble within a defined area while EyeQ SmartCones positioned around the edges display changing colours. Each player attempts to dribble towards cones showing their assigned colour, but when the cones change colour mid-approach, they must quickly scan, identify a new target, and change direction. This develops the ability to scan whilst dribbling, make rapid directional changes, and process visual information whilst maintaining ball control under dynamic conditions.

033 - Find Your Colour Finish

Players advance through zones towards goals positioned at different locations, with EyeQ SmartCones displaying colours that indicate which goal zone is currently attackable. The team in possession must scan to identify the active target colour, build play towards that zone, and finish into the corresponding goal before the cue changes. This trains forward progression with a scanning focus, recognition of which attacking channel to prioritise, and coordinated team movements to exploit the active goal opportunity.

014 - Pass Through Centre

Two teams play possession around a central square, supported by one or two neutrals. EyeQ SmartCones on the outside edges provide colour cues that change the passing task: sometimes the ball must go through the central square, sometimes it must be switched wide, and sometimes the ball-carrier must shield. The game connects scanning with different build-up behaviours, training players to check the cues regularly, recognise which tactical action is required, and execute central penetration, wide switches, or patient shielding based on visual information.

034 - Red or Green or Blue Pass-Through

Teams play possession and attempt to pass or dribble through gates positioned around the area, but EyeQ SmartCones display colours (red, green, blue) that indicate which gates are currently active for scoring. Players must scan whilst maintaining possession, identify open gates based on colour matching, and create passing combinations or dribbling lines to penetrate through the correct openings. This develops possession with a purpose, continuous scanning for breakthrough opportunities, and patient build-up whilst waiting for the right gate to activate.

020 - EyeQ Reactive 2v1 Shooting

An attacking player receives the ball with their back to goal whilst a defender applies pressure, and an EyeQ SmartCone flashes a colour cue as the pass arrives. The colour determines whether the attacker should lay the ball off to a supporting player, turn and attack 1v1, or switch play to the opposite side. This trains attackers to scan whilst receiving under pressure, process the cue quickly, and execute the correct technical action - all whilst competing physically with a defender in a realistic finishing scenario.
